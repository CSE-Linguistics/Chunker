CRF Chunker
* We use CRF model to perform B,I,O tagging of the sentences.
* The notebook contains all the code required to train the model, make predictions and perform error analysis.
* One can run the notebook on google colab after uploading the dataset to "/content" directory in colab.
* Another alternative is to install all the requirements locally, change the path for loading data in the code and then run the code locally.
